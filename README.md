## Full stack react app --REACT-WITH-ME (E-LEARNING-ENROLLMENT-APPLICATION)

``` Ali Mohammed Alvin Turuk a client, has decided that he would 
   want to build an application that will enable him reach out to more students regardless of geolocation in his country.

   He is the owner of a ficticious I.T school, but currently needs an online elearning platform. From the requirement gathering and little information obtained as stated below: 

   - I want an E-learning platform that sells course on line
   - Users must be authenticated
   - User can search for a course
   - I want users to enroll for multiple courses
   
   - There would be 3 level of users - students, instructors, admin
   - There would be a dashboard to see analytics and payments
   - Admin should manage the application and features
   - I want payments to be via paystack platform
   - I want something like an ecommerce platform where by the user after enrolling for a course , can then proceed to the course content. ```


   ``` With this information , you as a full stack developer in your company are then required to bring these information above to reality. Use database persistence where necessary and json data to mimic information in static pages. Your application should provide  the basic functionality  as Mohammed insist on a show me do demo version before your company would be awarded the contract. Dead line is your constraint and yet you must provide efficient production ready code in 4 days and not cut corners.

   Write solid codes following design principles approach and keep in mind that your application should meet the eye of the prospective client.

   This task given stands from the point of  a real world day to day challenge on developers with little information given but expected to present out of the box a good finished production ready code well documented and tested.
   ```


   ``` Your stack chosen for this task is react the redux way and laravel/php or node js```

   GOOD LUCK VICTOR
