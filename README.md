# Full stack react app

```Mohammed Alvin Turuk a client, has decided that he would 
   want to build an application that will enable him reach out to more students regardless of geolocation.

   He is the owner of a ficticious school, but currently needs an online elearning platform. From the requirement gathering and little information obtained as stated below

   - I want an E-learning platform that sells course on line
   - I want users to enroll for multiple courses
   - Users must be authenticated
   - There would be 3 level of users - students, instructors, admin
   - There would be a dashboard to see analytics and payments
   - Admin should manage the application and features
   - I want payments to be via paystack platform
   - I want something like an ecommerce platform where by the user after enrolling for a course , can then proceed to the course content. ```


   ``` With this information , you as a full stack developer in your company are then required to bring these information above to reality. Your application should provide  the basic functionality  as Mohammed insist on a show me do demo version before your company would be awarded the contract. Dead line is your constraint and yet you must provide efficient production ready code in 4 days```


   ``` Your stack chosen for this task is react the redux way and laravel/php or node js```

   GOOD LUCK VICTOR
