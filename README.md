## Full stack react app --REACT-WITH-ME (E-LEARNING-ENROLLMENT-APPLICATION)

``` Ali Mohammed Alvin Turuk a client who is a very busy person, has decided that he would 
   want to build an application that will enable him reach out to more students regardless of geo-location barrier.

   He is the owner of a ficticious I.T school where learning and teaching is the sole aim of the business done only on -site and in premise. Currently there is a needs for an online elearning platform to bridge the gap in sales of their educational services. From the drafted requirement gathering and little information obtained after a brief discussion with Ali Mohammed , only but a few information specification was gotten as stated below: 

   - I want an E-learning platform that sells course on line
   - Users must be authenticated
   - User can search for a course
   - I want users to enroll for multiple courses free or paid
   - Courses are categorized
   - There would be 3 level of users - students, instructors, admin
   - There would be a dashboard to see analytics and payments
   - Admin should manage the application and features
   - Instructor can add up course material and approval will be done by admin, these course information are available in the course detail page . the course lessons and modules are not going to be part of these scenario
   
   - I want payments to be via one or two payment gateways e.g paystack platform , flutter, stripe e.t.c
   - I want something like an ecommerce platform where by the user after enrolling for a course , can then proceed to the course content. But i would want for now to concentrate on the user being able to enrol for a course , see his cart, add to wishlist, checkout and make payments, manage profile, manage account settings.. These were his words after the discussion held with Ali Mohammed prior to the last meeting held with the outsourcing team:  """I will give you more details if i have more time. But I need it up and running as soon as possible. A quick functioning application and must be with the latest technological trend. I know you understand what I mean? You are a professional and I presume you do have in place a team with such outstanding expertise to can carry out the nitty gritty assignment and make this happen Right or wrong???"""```


   ``` With this information , you as an aspiring full stack developer in our company are then required to bring these information above to reality and all the burden lies on you to show your tech skills. """We need this project Victor""". Use database persistence where necessary and json data to mimic responses to information needed in static pages which you are to provide content your self. As we need something very fast to nail this contract. Your application should provide  the basic functionality  as Mohammed insist on a show me  demo version before your company would be awarded the contract of a million dollar to proceed with the pro versioning. Dead line is your constraint and yet you must provide efficient production ready code in the range of 4- 7 days and not cut corners. Do not write piece meals codes.

   Write solid codes following design principles approach and keep in mind that your application should meet the eye of the prospective client. You are expected to extend and improve on the requirement specification to pin point out details left out and create features not given since you are a professional in these field of play. To extend  the point further more, details not found in the specification scope is to  be implemented by you as you would be the lead developer on this project.

   This task given stands from the point of  a real world day to day challenge on developers with little information given but expected to present out of the box a good finished production ready code well documented and tested.
   ```


   ``` Your stack chosen for this task is react the redux way and laravel/php or node js```

   GOOD LUCK VICTOR!!!...

   Good LUCK AGAIN.
