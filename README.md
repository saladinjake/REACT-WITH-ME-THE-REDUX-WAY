##Senior Full stack react app/Senior Frontend/Backend ## --REACT-WITH-ME (E-LEARNING-ENROLLMENT-APPLICATION)




- Ali Mohammed Alvin Turuk a client 
who is a very busy person, has decided that he would 
want to build an application that will
enable him reach out to more 
students regardless of geo-location barrier.

- He is the owner of a ficticious I.T  school (EMS)
where learning and teaching is the sole aim of
the business done only on -site and in premise.
- Currently there is a needs for an online elearning platform  to bridge the gap in sales of their
   educational services and a need to offer flexibilty in learning from any where. He decides to go digital and contacted your company.

- From the drafted requirement gathering and conversation with
the client, only but a few information 
 was gotten as stated below: 

- I want an E-learning platform that sells course on line
- Users must be authenticated
- User can search for a course
- I want users to enroll for multiple courses free 
or paid
- Courses are categorized
- There would be 3 level of users - students, 
instructors, admin
- There would be a dashboard to see analytics 
and payments
- Admin should manage the application and
features
- Instructor can add up course material and 
approval will be done by admin, these course
information are available in the course 
detail page . the course lessons and modules 
are not going to be part of these scenario
   
- I want payments to be via one or two payment 
gateways e.g paystack platform , flutter, stripe e.t.c
- I want something like an ecommerce platform 
where by the user after enrolling for a course ,
 can then proceed to the course content. 
- But i would want for now to concentrate on
the user being able to  manage profile, manage account settings, enrol for a course , 
see his cart, add to wishlist, checkout and
make payments because EMS needs to make profit.
 
- Finally I need proper code documentation for the future 
  
- These were his words after the discussion 
  held with Ali Mohammed prior to the last meeting held 
  with the outsourcing team:  """I will give
  you more details if i have more time. But I need 
  it up and running as soon as possible. 
  A quick functioning application and must
  be with the latest technological trend. React atleast!!!
  I know you understand what I mean? 
  You are a professional and I presume 
  you do have in place a team with such
  outstanding expertise to can carry 
  out the nitty gritty assignment and 
  make this happen Right or wrong???"""


- With this information , you as an aspiring
   full stack developer in our company are then
   required to bring these information above 
   to reality and all the burden lies on you 
   to show your tech skills. """We need this
   project Victor""". Hint: Use database persistence
   where necessary and json data to mimic responses
   to information needed in static pages 
   which you are to provide good content 
   your self. 

 -  As we need something very fast
   to nail this contract, your application 
   should provide  the basic functionality 
   as Mohammed insist on a show me  demo 
   version before your company would be 
   awarded the contract of a million dollar
   to proceed with the pro versioning. 


 -  Dead line is your constraint and yet
   you must provide efficient production 
   ready code in the range of 4- 7 days 
   and not cut corners to achieve this goal.
 -   Keep in mind that you are 
   required to build a good looking interface for different
   pages. 
 -  Where contents are not available; use the famous lorem ipsum data. 

 -  You are not expected to write simple or
   piece meals codes. 

 -  Your codes should be production ready
   on  both frontend and backend scripts.

 -  On the frontend , Your codes should be component based
   and reuseable for future use in further task assigned to you.

 -  On the backend loose coupling, dependency injection 
   , design and solid principles, oop should be your best
   way basis. 

 -  Api Documentation is a necessity.

 -  Write solid codes following design principles 
   approach and keep in mind that your application 
   should meet the eye of the prospective client.


 -  You are expected to extend and improve on the 
   requirement specification to pin point out details
   left out and create features not given since 
   you are a professional in these field of play.


 -  To extend  the point further more, details not
   found in the specification scope are to  be
   implemented by you because  you  have assumed
   a lead role and other developers are 
   currently assigned to handle other task.

 -  From the onset of design to implementation,
   You alone are incharge.

 -  This task given stands from the point of  
   a real world day to day challenge for a Fullstack developer
   with little information given but expected 
   to present out of the box a good finished production
   ready code well documented and tested.


   Are you fit for this role? 
  -


   ``` Your stack chosen for this task is react the redux way and laravel/php or node js```

   GOOD LUCK VICTOR!!!...

   Good LUCK AGAIN.
   MICK DURHAM.
